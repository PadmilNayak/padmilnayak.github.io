* I have implemented the algorithm to construct Quantum circuit which is representative to a classical Bayesian network.
* I have Performed various approximate inference strategies such as Gibbs, Metropolis-Hastings & Likelihood-weighted sampling for classical and Hybrid approximate inference in Bayesian networks
* Analyzed the performance for various types of queries to conclude statistically significant performance improvement for inferring diagnostic queries.
